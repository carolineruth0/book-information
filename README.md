Title: Book Information

Description: This project displays books from a JSON file. The files in this project contain code provided by the Full Stack Development with MERN course with edits by me.

How to run: Download all files. Node.js is required. Use powershell and navigate to the folder with the downloads. Start a server in that folder and put its address in your browser.

Future improvements: I would like to make the subtitle at the top smaller and italics.
